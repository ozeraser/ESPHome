/*  A CWWW plugin for Single Pin temperature and single pin brightness Globes.

The current inbuilt ESPHome CWWW plugin caters for a globe with 2 flout outputs, one for cool white and one for warm white,
the existing function then changes the values for these to mix colour and perform brightness corrections on theese values.

This ESPHome function is built for CWWW globes from tuya where one pin controlls CWWW with 0 being warm white and 1 being cool white,
the second pin controlls the brightness of the lamp.

Reported lamps that use this single pin method of temperature at point of creation;
SL6 Smart Bulb
Arlec Grid Connect GLD112HA / GLD110HA
BrilliantSmart 20695/05 Downlight CCT Light
Various Tuya rebadged smart globes.

This custom lightoutput changes the separate cwhite and wwhite channels from 1-0 to a combined 1-0, removes the brightness adjustment.
Sends the brightness to the brightness pin.


******* Ensure you set the correct min and max mireds below in this code (Line 79, 80). To work out the mireds you just divide 1000000 by the Kelvin value.
e.g
LED 5700K, 1000000/5700 = 175 mireds
LED 3000K, 1000000/3000 = 333 mireds

TODO:
Add additional function variables to take Kelvin from the yaml call and convert to mireds on the fly, would need to ensure the highest and lowest because mireds is backwards.

Usage:
Place this file into the ESPhome config directory

Include the following line into your ESPHOME yaml config under the board section at the same level.

*******
  includes:
  - CWWWSinglepintempandbrightnessLightOutput.h
*******

Include the following lines into your ESPHOME yaml config, changing pins if required.
*******
light:
  - platform: custom
    lambda: |-
      auto light_out = new CWWWSinglepintempandbrightnessLightOutput(id(output_brightness), id(output_temp));
      App.register_component(light_out);
      return {light_out};
    lights:
      - name: $display_name
        restore_mode: ALWAYS_ON
